This strategy is going to be used on Mt5 platform and this is how it goes:
 
1. This robot must only work in the time frame and symbol that is applied on
2. Check for the recent closed candlestick 
3. Highest high, place buy oder 
4. Lowest low, place sell oder 
5. Stop-loss for buy order, is the price of sell oder
6. Stop-loss for sell oder is the price of the buy oder
7. No take profit 
8. All open order must be closed and all unopened orders must be deleted when new candlestick open 
9. The same process must repeat itself on the next closed candlestick 
10. This process must take place non stop
10. The robot must have settings to adjust lot size
